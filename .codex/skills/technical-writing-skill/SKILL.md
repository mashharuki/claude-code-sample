# Technical Blog Writing Skill

This skill is designed to help you write technical blog posts that are not only informative but also engaging and widely read on platforms like Zenn and Qiita.

## 🧠 Mindset: The "Future Self" & "Reader-First"

-   **Write for your future self**: If you stumbled upon this problem again in 6 months, what would you want to read?
-   **Reader-First**: Respect the reader's time. Give them the value (the "Aha!" moment) as quickly as possible.
-   **Continuity**: A good article is a "snapshot" of your learning journey. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it must be honest and helpful.

## ✍️ Workflow

### 1. Topic & Persona
-   **Who is this for?** (e.g., "Beginners to React", "Senior Backend Engineers struggling with scaling")
-   **What problem does it solve?** Be specific. "How to fix Error X" is better than "About Error X".

### 2. Outlining (The "Skeleton" Method)
-   Start with the **Conclusion** (What will the reader take away?).
-   Draft the **Introduction** (Hook the reader, state the problem, promise the solution).
-   List the **Headings** (The steps to get from Problem to Solution).
-   *Tip*: Use the `view_file` tool to read the `templates/` directory for ready-to-use structures.

### 3. Drafting
-   Fill in the sections.
-   Use **Code Blocks** generously. Ensure they are copy-paste ready.
-   Use **Zenn/Qiita specific markdown** (Alerts, Details) to make it readable. See `resources/markdown_cheatsheet.md`.

### 4. Polishing
-   **Title is King**: Spend 50% of your time on the title. See `resources/active_title_patterns.md`.
-   **Eye-catching OGP**: If possible, create a simple but clear OGP image.

## 🚀 Viral Checklist

Before publishing, check these points:
-   [ ] **Title**: Does it contain specific keywords, numbers, or a strong benefit? (e.g., "3 ways to...", "Finally solved...")
-   [ ] **Intro**: Do you state the "Goal" and "Target Audience" in the first 10 lines?
-   [ ] **Scannability**: Can you understand the main points just by reading the headers?
-   [ ] **Actionability**: Can the reader immediately apply what they learned?
-   [ ] **completeness**: Did you include environment details (OS, versions) to prevent "works on my machine" issues?
